## 👋 About Me
I studied Medicine in Argentina until the third year, where I strengthened my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.
After moving to Portugal, I began working as a receptionist at a student residence, where I discovered my passion for technology by designing **automations and digital workflows** that optimized daily operations.

Today, I am fully committed to building a career in **Data Analytics**, learning through platforms such as **Platzi, DataCamp, and Udemy**, and applying new tools to improve processes in my current role.
I am **proactive, curious, and detail-oriented**, motivated by challenges and a continuous drive for learning and growth.
